tl;dr creating bins for a histogram of discrete data in `numpy` can be a bit tricky since the last bin is inclusive, so we have to shift the bins by half, and then add our own ticks

For example, I was comparing multiple GPS/GNSS receivers which report back how many satellites they have a fix on, which I stored in a dataframe as `df['satellites']`. The maximum value I found was 15, and the minimum was 1 satellite.

Generally we want to create the bins from `(min - 0.5) ... (max + 0.5)` since we want the bins centered on the integer values for our discrete data.  It's easiest to do this with `bins = np.arange(min, max + 2) - 0.5`. Since `np.arange(start, end)` is not inclusive of `end` we need the extra `+2`. 

So in the case of $n \in \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 15\}$, we need to create a sequence  `1...16`  and then shift it down by 0.5 so that the first bin is `[0.5, 1.5)` and the last bin will be `[14.5, 15.5]`. In numpy this is `bin_edges = np.arange(1, np.max(data) + 2) - 0.5:

```python
bin_edges = np.arange(1, np.max(df1['satellites']+2)) - 0.5  
```

And then we create the ticks for the center of the bins, which is `[min,...,max]`, or `np.arange(min, max + 1)`:
```python
ticks = np.arange(1, np.max(df1['satellites'])+1)
```


Input
==TODO== Full code
```python
bin_edges = np.arange(1, (np.max(df1['satellites']+2)))-0.5  
ticks = np.arange(1, (np.max(df1['satellites'])+1))
ax1.hist(df1['satellites'], bins=bin_edges, rwidth=0.8, color='blue', alpha=0.5, label='LEA-6H')
```

Output
```
Bin Edges: [ 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 10.5 11.5 12.5 13.5 14.5 15.5] Ticks: [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15]
```

Note we can also verify we have the right bins with:
```
df1["satellites"].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
```

> Key point: Bins are "half-open", except for the rightmost bin.
